# Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you get started with SuiPulse by walking through a simple example of creating and managing a data stream.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16 or later
- npm or yarn
- Basic familiarity with Sui blockchain

## Installation

Install the SuiPulse SDK:

```bash
npm install @suipulse/sdk
```

## Basic Usage

### 1. Initialize the Client

```typescript
import { SuiPulseClient } from "@suipulse/sdk";

const client = new SuiPulseClient({
  network: "devnet",
  // Optional: provide your wallet for authenticated operations
  wallet: wallet,
});
```

### 2. Create a Data Stream

```typescript
const stream = await client.createStream({
  name: "my-first-stream",
  description: "A simple example stream",
});

console.log("Stream created:", stream.id);
```

### 3. Update Stream Data

```typescript
await client.updateStream(stream.id, {
  temperature: 25.5,
  humidity: 60,
  timestamp: Date.now(),
});
```

### 4. Subscribe to Updates

```typescript
const unsubscribe = await client.subscribeToStream(stream.id, (data) => {
  console.log("New data:", data);
});

// Later: stop listening for updates
unsubscribe();
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've created your first stream, you can:

- Learn about [Data Streams](/docs/core-concepts/data-streams) in detail
- Explore [Snapshots](/docs/core-concepts/snapshots) for state management
- Set up [Access Control](/docs/core-concepts/access-control) for your streams
