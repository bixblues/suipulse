# Ownership Transfer

Ownership transfer in SuiPulse allows you to transfer ownership of streams and snapshots to other addresses.

## Overview

Ownership transfer enables:

- Transferring stream ownership
- Transferring snapshot ownership
- Managing ownership permissions
- Verifying ownership changes

## Transferring Stream Ownership

```typescript
import { SuiPulse, Network } from "@suipulse/sdk";
import { Ed25519Keypair } from "@mysten/sui.js/keypairs/ed25519";

// Initialize SuiPulse
const keypair = Ed25519Keypair.fromSecretKey(/* your private key */);
const suiPulse = new SuiPulse(keypair, Network.MAINNET);

// Transfer stream ownership
const response = await suiPulse.transferStreamOwnership(
  "0x123...", // stream ID
  "0x456..." // new owner address
);
```

## Transferring Snapshot Ownership

```typescript
// Transfer snapshot ownership
const response = await suiPulse.transferSnapshot(
  "0x123...", // snapshot ID
  "0x456..." // new owner address
);
```

## Ownership Verification

```typescript
// Get stream owner
const stream = await suiPulse.getDataStream("0x123...");
console.log("Stream owner:", stream.owner);

// Get snapshot owner
const snapshot = await suiPulse.getSnapshotData("0x123...");
console.log("Snapshot owner:", snapshot.owner);
```

## Best Practices

1. **Security**

   - Verify recipient address
   - Confirm ownership before transfer
   - Use secure channels for transfer
   - Implement proper access control

2. **Transaction Management**

   - Handle transfer failures
   - Verify transfer success
   - Monitor ownership changes
   - Maintain transfer logs

3. **Access Control**
   - Update permissions after transfer
   - Notify relevant parties
   - Update access lists
   - Handle permission inheritance

## Use Cases

- Asset transfer
- Business ownership changes
- Access control updates
- Permission management
- Organizational restructuring
