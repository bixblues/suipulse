## Development Roadmap: Sui Native Decentralized Data Mesh

### **Overview**

This roadmap details the step-by-step process to build a decentralized data mesh protocol on Sui, leveraging its object-centric model, parallel execution, and Walrus programmable storage. The plan is designed for a 24-day hackathon sprint, focusing on core deliverables, relevant technologies, and a compelling final demonstration.

---

## **Technologies & Tools**

- **Sui Blockchain:** Core platform for object-centric smart contracts and parallel execution[4][5].
- **Move Language:** For writing secure, resource-oriented smart contracts on Sui[4][5].
- **Sui SDK (TypeScript/JS):** For dApp front-end and off-chain interactions[1][5].
- **Walrus Storage:** For persistent, decentralized storage of historical data and snapshots.
- **Frontend Framework:** React.js (for rapid UI development).
- **Node.js:** Backend API layer (if needed for mesh orchestration).
- **Testing:** Sui Testnet, Sui CLI, and simulation tools[1][4].
- **Documentation:** Sui Docs, Metaschool Sui guides, and in-code comments[1][5].

## **Step-by-Step Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: Planning & Architecture (Days 1–2)**

- Define core data mesh features: publish, subscribe, update, compose data streams.
- Design Sui object structure for data streams (ownership, access control, metadata).
- Plan Walrus integration for historical data.
- Outline MVP demo scenario (e.g., real-time DeFi dashboard or collaborative leaderboard).

### **Phase 2: Smart Contract Development (Days 3–8)**

- Set up Sui dev environment and Move toolchain[1][4].
- Implement core Move contracts:
  - **DataStream Object:** Represents a live data feed.
  - **Publish Function:** Allows dApps to create/update streams.
  - **Subscribe Function:** Enables other dApps/users to follow streams.
  - **Access Control:** Ownership, permissions, composability logic.
- Unit test contracts locally and on Sui Testnet[1][4].

### **Phase 3: Walrus Storage Integration (Days 9–11)**

- Integrate Walrus for storing historical data and snapshots.
- Write Move logic or off-chain scripts to sync live streams with Walrus.
- Test retrieval and persistence of historical data.

### **Phase 4: SDK/Toolkit Development (Days 12–15)**

- Build a TypeScript/JS SDK for easy integration:
  - Publish/subscribe API wrappers.
  - Utilities for data stream composition.
  - Example code snippets for dApp developers.
- Write documentation and usage guides[1][4].

### **Phase 5: Frontend Demo Application (Days 16–20)**

- Develop a React.js dApp showcasing the data mesh:
  - Live dashboard (e.g., DeFi metrics, gaming leaderboard, or social feed).
  - Real-time updates from multiple data streams.
  - Historical data view (via Walrus).
  - Compose and remix data streams in the UI.
- Connect frontend to Sui via SDK and contracts.

### **Phase 6: Testing, Optimization, and Documentation (Days 21–22)**

- Test all flows on Sui Testnet under simulated multi-user load.
- Optimize Move contracts for gas efficiency and parallelism[4][5].
- Finalize SDK and write clear documentation for developers and users.
- Prepare troubleshooting and FAQ sections.

### **Phase 7: Final Demo Preparation (Days 23–24)**

- Polish UI/UX for clarity and impact.
- Prepare a 5-minute live demo script:
  - Show live creation and subscription to data streams.
  - Demonstrate real-time updates and composability.
  - Highlight Walrus-powered historical data retrieval.
  - Explain Sui-specific advantages (object-centric model, parallel execution).
- Prepare slides/visuals explaining architecture and ecosystem impact.

## **Guidelines for Each Technology**

| Component       | Technology           | Guidelines                                                                                         |
| --------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Smart Contracts | Move on Sui          | Use Sui’s object model for modularity; follow best practices for security and composability[4][5]. |
| Storage         | Walrus               | Store historical data and snapshots; ensure easy retrieval and sync with live streams.             |
| SDK             | TypeScript/JS        | Abstract contract calls; provide simple publish/subscribe APIs for dApp developers.                |
| Frontend        | React.js             | Focus on real-time data visualization and composability features.                                  |
| Testing         | Sui Testnet          | Simulate multi-user scenarios; use Sui CLI for contract deployment and testing[1][4].              |
| Documentation   | Sui Docs, Metaschool | Write clear guides; include code samples and troubleshooting tips[1][5].                           |
