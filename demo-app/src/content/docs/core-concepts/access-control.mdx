# Access Control

SuiPulse provides flexible access control mechanisms to secure your data streams. You can configure who can read and write to your streams, ensuring data privacy and security.

## Access Levels

### Public Access

Anyone can read the stream data.

```typescript
await client.updateStreamPermissions(stream.id, {
  readAccess: "public",
  writeAccess: "private",
});
```

### Private Access

Only authorized addresses can read and write.

```typescript
await client.updateStreamPermissions(stream.id, {
  readAccess: "private",
  writeAccess: "private",
  authorizedReaders: ["0x123..."],
  authorizedWriters: ["0x123..."],
});
```

### Write-Restricted Access

Anyone can read, but only authorized addresses can write.

```typescript
await client.updateStreamPermissions(stream.id, {
  readAccess: "public",
  writeAccess: "private",
  authorizedWriters: ["0x123..."],
});
```

## Managing Permissions

### Adding Authorized Users

```typescript
await client.addAuthorizedUsers(stream.id, {
  readers: ["0x456..."],
  writers: ["0x789..."],
});
```

### Removing Authorized Users

```typescript
await client.removeAuthorizedUsers(stream.id, {
  readers: ["0x456..."],
  writers: ["0x789..."],
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**

   - Grant only necessary permissions
   - Regularly review access lists
   - Remove unused permissions

2. **Permission Management**

   - Use role-based access control
   - Implement permission inheritance
   - Monitor access patterns

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Rotate authorized addresses
   - Implement multi-signature for critical operations
   - Use secure key management

## Common Use Cases

- Private data sharing
- Multi-party collaboration
- Enterprise data management
- Regulatory compliance
